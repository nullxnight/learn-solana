# SOLANA

## What is solana 
just another blockchain like etherium, bitcoin or other

## Main question should be why solana:

1. **Faster transaction in compaire to other blockchain fairly take 2 or more sec**
2. **Less transection fee(gas)**
3. **High nakamoto coefficient(decentralized score)**

# Cryptography and the Solana Network

### Before starting, let's get familiar with some terms:

1. **Keypairs: A combination of a public key and a secret key.**
2. **Public Key: In Solana, it's just an address used to map an account.**
3. **Secret Key/Private Key: Used to verify authority over the account. [If you don't have the secret key, then it's not your account.]**

## Cryptography(Study of hiding information):
=> There are two typr of cryptography:
    
    1. Symmetric cryptography
    2. Asymmetric Cryptography

## Symmetric cryptography:
- Here we just use single/same key to encrypt and decrypt data.

- The most common symmetric cryptography encryptions are AES and ChaCha20 (a refined version of Salsa20) [RFC-7539].
